# API Testing Automation Library 
## Project Description 
The API Testing Automation Library automates the testing and validation of products using the Deriv API. Initially focused on vanilla products, the library now supports Vanilla, Rise/Fall, Multiplier, Turbo and Accumulator, with added features such as GUI integration for easy testing, data export, and command-line execution. The tool simplifies switching product parameters, validating pricing, and managing accounts through a user-friendly interface. Dependencies can be easily installed via requirements.txt for a streamlined setup on different environments.

### Instructions to Clone the Repository

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - On macOS, press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal" in the search bar, and hit Enter.

2. **Navigate to the Directory** where you'd like to clone the repository (optional):
   - Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where you want the repository to be cloned:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/desired/folder/
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual Git repository URL (e.g., GitHub URL) and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Example:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/regentmarkets/quants-model-validation.git
   ```

4. **Navigate into the Cloned Repository**:

   ```bash
   cd quants-model-validation
   ```

The repository is now cloned to your local machine, and you can proceed with further setup steps such as installing dependencies or running the scripts.

### Instructions to Install Dependencies from `requirements.txt`

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - On macOS, press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal" in the search bar, and hit Enter.

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:
   Use the `cd` command to move to the directory where your project files (including `requirements.txt`) are located. Replace `/path/to/your/project/` with the actual folder path on your machine.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project/
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/Repos/Personal/1\ API\ framework/
   ```

3. **Install the Required Packages**:
   Run the following command to install all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Instructions to Run the Script by Double-Clicking (via `.command` File)

1. **Make the `.command` File Executable**:
   - Open **Terminal** and navigate to the folder where the `.command` file is located:
   
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/your/project/
     ```

   - Make the `.command` file executable by running the following command:

     ```bash
     chmod +x run_mvapi.command
     ```

2. **Run the `.command` File**:
   - Open **Finder** and navigate to the project folder where both the `run_mvapi.command` and `mvapi.py` files are located.
   - **Double-click** the `run_mvapi.command` file.

   This will launch the script in a new **Terminal** window, and `mvapi.py` will run automatically.

---


### Instructions to Run the Script via Terminal (Command Line)

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - On macOS, press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal" in the search bar, and hit Enter.

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:
   Use the `cd` command to move to the directory where your project files are located (replace `/path/to/your/project/` with the actual folder path on your machine).

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project/
   ```

   Example:
   
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/Repos/quants-model-validation/Other Projects/API Testing Automation Project/
   ```
   
3. **Run the Python Script** using Python 3:

   ```bash
   python3 mvapi.py
   ```

  * Bid price check (in-progress)
  * Close at expiry check (in-progress)

Milestones achieved as of 19/06/24:
* Improved error handling
  * Automatically handles connection issues with websocket
  * Automatically handles more contract validation errors (e.g. invalid stake/payout per point)
* Turbo option validation:
  * payout per points choices validation

Milestones achieved as of 01/07/24:
* Add Turbo validation functions
  * Add validation of pricing for sold, expired, knocked out and currently open contracts
  * improve payout per point choices and barrier validation functions
* Overall project
  * Refractor validation functions and error handling functions
  * Improved overall error handling

Milestones achieved as of 02/07/24:
  * Overall Project
    * Project has been exported to a .py python module (mvapi.py) and can now be imported
    * Refractored and cleaned up code
  * Accumulators
    * Tick size barrier for accumulators are no longer hard coded and are calculated based on given loss probabilities
