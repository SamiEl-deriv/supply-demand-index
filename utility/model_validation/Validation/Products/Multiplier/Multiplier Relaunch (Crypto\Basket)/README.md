## Summary

This report covers the validation on Multiplier next tick implementation on entry/start spot for DerivGO and API. The validation covers Cryptocurrencies and Basket Indices. Based on the validation, the next tick execution is now indeed implemented for both Cryptocurrencies and Basket Indices.

To summarise the results:

##### 1 Non-blocker:
The only point to note is that there is a possibility for the next tick to occur 2 seconds after the start time due to a missing tick in between. This is not an issue with the implementation of next tick execution.

## Context

A group of clients consistently profits from the Financial Multiplier product due to:

- The inability to hedge our product. 

- Latency by our current feed infrastructre.

The solution chosen is to implement the next tick as a simple solution. Details on the issue in [wiki js](https://wikijs.deriv.cloud/en/trading/dealing/trading-ops_non-linear/trading-incident-investigation-registry/incidents/incident_financial_multiplier_group_traders_2022).

## Validation Methodology

To check on DerivGO & API that all multiplier contracts on the listed underlyings are executed using next tick implementation.

### Assumptions
