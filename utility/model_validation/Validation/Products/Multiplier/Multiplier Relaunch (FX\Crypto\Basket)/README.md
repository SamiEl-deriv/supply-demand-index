## Summary

This report covers the validation on Multiplier next tick implementation on entry/start spot. The validation also covers Forex Major Pairs, Basket Indices and Cryptocurrencies.

To summarize the result:
- 2 issues found.
  - 0 Blocker
  - 1 Non-Blocker
  - 1 Resolved

The Non-Blocker issue is that the next tick has yet implemented for all Basket Indices. It is not a blocker as we can relaunch the multipliers for FX Major Pairs and Cryptocurrencies first.

## Context

A group of clients consistently profits from the Financial Multiplier product due to:

- The inability to hedge our product. 

- Latency by our current feed infrastructre.

The solution chosen is to implement the next tick as a simple solution. Details on the issue in [wiki js](https://wikijs.deriv.cloud/en/trading/dealing/trading-ops_non-linear/trading-incident-investigation-registry/incidents/incident_financial_multiplier_group_traders_2022).
